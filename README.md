## flex-challenges

I decided to upload my results as Python Notebooks since i think it is the most practical way to share results and explain code.
I hope this works for you, otherwise just let me know and i will upload the results as .py as well. 

[data_challenge.ipynb](data_challenge.ipynb) includes the data analysis tasks.

[quant_challenge.ipynb](quant_challenge.ipynb) includes the quant challenge. The third task is additionally uploaded as python script in application.py.
